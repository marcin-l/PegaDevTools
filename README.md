1. Load unpacked extension:

  - Click the `Load Temporary Add-on...` button
  - Navigate to the extracted ZIP file directory, select any file, and click *Open*.
  <br>Please note that this method is not persistent. Extension needs to be loaded for each Firefox session.

## Post-Installation
- Go to PDT [Extension Options](https://github.com/marcin-l/PegaDevTools/wiki/Configuration). In the *Site config* section add your environment domain name (e.g. `client-dt1.pegacloud.net`, without `https://`) and click *Save site configuration*. 
- Turn on features in the *Settings* section and click `Save settings`.
- Reload your Pega tabs if needed
<br>Some features will not work if this step is skipped

## Updating to a New Version
- Overwrite extension with new download, your settings will be left intact
- Go to Chrome/Edge settings
- Click `Extensions`
- Reload PegaDevTools
- Check the PDT Extension Options to see if there are any new features to be enabled

## Known Issues and Limitations
- System rules customizations in Dev Studio will stop working when a rule is refreshed (to be addressed in the future). Reopen the rule to restore customizations.
- Some features may not work when Dev Studio language is set to something other than English. Use the `ignore locale` option in user preferences as a workaround.
- Not all customizations will load if you open your application in App or Admin Studio. Set _Developer_ portal as the default for your Access Group to circumvent this issue.
- Firefox support is currently unavailable but coming soon.
